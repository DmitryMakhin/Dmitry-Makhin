## 💼 EXPERIENCE
### mBank: 11/2022 - Present, 3 years
- Conducted a comprehensive optimization of a legacy payment processing system: migrated critical modules to .NET 8, refactored the data architecture, and optimized SQL queries, which resulted in a 45% performance improvement in transaction processing and reduced API response time from 800ms to 350ms.
- Architected and developed a high-load calculation engine processing 50M+ daily transactions for interest rates and commissions. Deployed Redis distributed caching that improved response times by 70% and reduced database load by 45% through intelligent cache invalidation strategies.
- Established reliable asynchronous data exchange between bank microservices using RabbitMQ with guaranteed message delivery. Developed a transaction reprocessing mechanism for failures in integrations with external processing centers.
